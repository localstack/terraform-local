# `tflocal` - Terraform with LocalStack

This package provides `tflocal` - a small wrapper script to run [Terraform](https://terraform.io) against [LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `pip`
* `terraform`

## How it works

The script uses the [Terraform Override mechanism](https://www.terraform.io/language/files/override) and creates a temporary file `localstack_providers_override.tf` to configure the endpoints for the AWS `provider` section. The endpoints for all services are configured to point to the LocalStack API (`http://localhost:4566` by default).

## Installation

The `tflocal` command line interface can be installed via `pip`:
```
pip install terraform-local
```

## Configurations

The following environment variables can be configured:
* `TF_CMD`: Terraform command to call (default: `terraform`)
* `LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME`: host name of the target LocalStack instance
* `EDGE_PORT`: port number of the target LocalStack instance
* `S3_HOSTNAME`: special hostname to be used to connect to LocalStack S3 (default: `s3.localhost.localstack.cloud`)
* `USE_EXEC`: whether to use `os.exec` instead of `subprocess.Popen` (try using this in case of I/O issues)
* `<SERVICE>_ENDPOINT`: setting a custom service endpoint, e.g., `COGNITO_IDP_ENDPOINT=http://example.com`
* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: the AWS region to use (default: `us-east-1`, or determined from local credentials if `boto3` is installed)
* `CUSTOMIZE_ACCESS_KEY`: enables to override the static AWS Access Key ID. The following cases are taking precedence over each other from top to bottom:
    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable is set
    * `access_key` is set in the Terraform AWS provider
    * `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set and configured
    * `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` environment variable is set and configured
    * `default` profile's credentials are configured
    * falls back to the default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` mock value
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS Access Key ID to use for multi account setups (default: `test` -> account ID: `000000000000`)

## Usage

The `tflocal` command has the same usage as the `terraform` command. For detailed usage,
please refer to the man pages of `terraform --help`.
